# The Test
This repository is provided as my response to a technical test that I have been presented with.

## The Problem Statement
Set aside 2 hours to create some code that shows how you would code a minefield/minesweeper style game running on the command line (no UI), in order to demonstrate how you would code & test a real-world application using established best practices.

In the game a player navigates from one side of a chessboard grid to the other whilst trying to avoid hidden mines. The player has a number of lives, losing one each time a mine is hit, and the final score is the number of moves taken in order to reach the other side of the board.  The command line / console interface should be simple, allowing the player to input move direction (up, down, left, right) and the game to show the resulting position (e.g. C2 in chess board terminology) along with number of lives left and number of moves taken.

Above all else please follow these guidelines
1. Quality is more important than quantity
2. We will assess your ability to write clean-code that has good structure & is covered by meaningful tests
3. Donâ€™t code a UI

When complete, upload your code to a public GitHub repository and forward the URL to us.
Be prepared to talk through you code and explain key design features and coding principles and why you have used them.
Good luck!

## How I Tackled This
The first step to solving a problem is to understand the problem.  From the text above we can pull out some important features which will define requirements and inform the solution.  The Problem Statement above is not a complete specification, and in the absence of further input, assumptions will have to be made.  For example, the size of the Grid is not specified.

### The Problem Statement Distilled
This is a (Computer) Game.  Games have Players.  Players need a way to enter their Moves and influence the state of the Game.  A feedback mechanism that can inform them of their progress and help them formulate their next Move is also required.

Games typically have a 'Game Loop', similar to a Read-Eval-Print Loop; ie. the Player provides input stimuli (Read), those stimuli are evaluated and the state of the Game is updated / mutated (Eval), before the new state of the Game is fed back to the Player by rendering the frame (Print).  In this case, being a console application for a single Player, the loop will be along the lines of:
1. Read a keypress from the keyboard - for this Game the input can be a simple blocking operation as the Game does not change state without input and there is no need for continual feedback (eg. there are no animations requiring frame updates, nor players or other actors altering state concurrently).
2. Evaluate the keypress - if it is a known key (Up, Down, Left, Right) then attempt to move the Player in the requested direction; bounds checking will be required as will rules around Mines and Lives.  There should also be a key to exit the Game, although this was not explicitly mentioned.
3. Print the current location of the Player in the form of `A1`, `B7`, `C2`, etc.  There is no explicit mention in the Problem Statement of drawing the Grid but I will make the assumption that will provide better feedback to the Player and enhance the Game's appeal.  The number of remaining Lives and the number of Moves taken thus far are also required as outputs.

The Problem Statement also uses the terms Grid and Board somewhat interchangeably - I will rather arbitrarily settle on Grid in the absense of further input from the problem setter.  There is also no mention of the origin or direction for indexing the Grid - it will be assumed that the origin will be the top-left corner; rows are numbered and increment top-to-bottom starting at `1`, whereas columns are lettered and increment left-to-right starting at `A`.

We can see from the Problem Statement that if the Player moves to a Grid square that contains a Mine then the number of Lives needs to be decremented.  The Problem Statement does not mention what happens if the Player steps on the same Mine more than once - the assumption will be that only the first encounter will reduce the number of Lives.

The Problem Statement does not specify what happens when the number of Lives is reduced to zero (or indeed whether it can go below zero).  Nor is the initial number of Lives specified.  These requirements will need to be assumed - it is sensible to terminate the Game when there are no more Lives for the Player, and it is sensible to make the initial number of Lives a configurable parameter as the problem setter may wish to vary the difficulty; the cost of making this particular parameter configurable is neglegible.

There is no mention of the number of Mines or what happens if the Player does not make it from one side of the Grid to the other before the Lives are depleted.  Again, the sensible assumption would be to make the number of Mines configurable, and the obvious behaviour on reaching zero Lives would be to exit the Game.  One potential problem here is the location of the Mines - if the Player is to start in the left-hand column and the number of Mines is configurable, it may be possible that all of the Player's potential initial positions are mined.  There are several ways around this problem, but it is a complication nonetheless - one that has not been specified for.

Because we have made the decision to use a blocking operation for keypresses (for simplicity), it initially seems to make sense to reorder the loop slightly so that the Player can see the initial state of the Grid - Print-Read-Eval.  However, upon completing the game there will be no visual feedback showing the Player's updated position; a classic 'off-by-one' error.  We will keep the initial Read-Eval-Print ordering and instead insert an initial Print step prior to entering the loop.

### The Code
In the absence of any provided coding standards, I will opt for my own style which is based on the guidelines set out in Clean Code but with the norms of C# rather than Java (PascalCase rather than camelCase for method names, for example).

The Problem Statement is instructing me to set aside 2 hours and the emphasis is on quality and not quantity.  I will be adding to the repository as time allows over a period of several days but I do not envisage the exercise will be completed within 2 hours due to various other commitments.  Hopefully there is sufficient here to give a fair impression of my work but there is also a handful of other hardware, software and firmware examples in my personal GitHub repositories [here](https://github.com/pete-restall) and [here](https://githum.com/lophtware).

Convention-based Dependency Injection will be leveraged based on Scrutor - this should prevent the Big Ball of Mud that the default Microsoft DI framework encourages.  This application is not envisaged to be large enough to properly benefit from this but wishing to see an approach to DI was mentioned in correspondence outside of the Problem Statement.

The code will be written in a Top-Down fashion, ie. starting at the program entry-point (`Program.cs`) and elaborating into the details.  Although the analysis above shows a general solution centred around a Game Loop, the actual direction of travel when writing the code will be dictated by the tests, ie. TDD (Red-Green-Refactor).
